# Rustborn - Hytale Modjam First Edition :3

**Rustborn** It is a mod set in a desert environment. You must search for parts for your robot, fully exploring the surface of zone 2, find parts with different rarities, and build your robot, which will follow you and fight alongside you.

## ✨ Features

* **36 Unique Robot Variants:** extensive combinations.
* **Component Rarity System:** Each robot part comes with specific rarity tiers:
  * **Head & Body:** 2 Rarity Tiers.
  * **Legs & Arms:** 3 Rarity Tiers.
* **Dynamic Stats:** The rarity of the parts directly impacts the robot's attributes, scaling its **Damage**, **Health**, and **Size**.

### ⚙️ Gameplay Mechanics

* **Taming & Combat:** Upon spawning, interact with the robot to tame it. Once tamed, it will **follow you** and automatically **attack your targets**.
* **Management GUI:** Interact with a tamed robot to open a detailed interface. Here you can check stats and monitor **Durability**.
* **Repair System:** Keep your robot operational using the **Repair Item** inside the GUI.
